## General info
PortfolioCreator is a webapp with Flask backend, that lets you create a portfolio webpage

## Setup


To run backend:
1. Go to src/python 
2. Install requirements: 
```
	"pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
```
3. Run application:
```
	"python3 main.py"
```
4. Run the /html/main.html


./html/index.html - webapp

./src/python - backend


## TODO 
* Improve the responsiveness of both main.html and created webpage [❌]
* Implementing the path folder mapping while creating .zip [❌]

## What's next? 
I plan to successively add more portfolio templates in my spare time, adding more features to them (dark mode, changing languages) and more exciting stuff
