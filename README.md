## General info
PortfolioCreator is simple a webapp with a Flask backend - it lets the user build his Portfolio Webpage simply by filling one form.

## Setup


To run backend:
1. Go to src/python 
2. Install requirements: 
```
	pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run application:
```
	python3 main.py
```
4. Run the /html/main.html


./html/index.html - webapp

./src/python - backend


## TODO 
* Improve the design and responsiveness of both main.html and created webpage [❌]
* Implement the path folder mapping while creating .zip [❌]

## What's next? 
I plan to successively add portfolio templates with better features (dark mode, animations and overall better design)
